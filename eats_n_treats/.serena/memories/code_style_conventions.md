# Code Style and Conventions

## General Conventions
- **Naming**: Follow standard C# naming conventions (PascalCase for types and methods, camelCase for local variables)
- **Project Naming**: Use snake_case for project names (e.g., shop_ui)
- **Implicit Usings**: Enabled - avoid explicit using statements for common namespaces
- **Nullable Reference Types**: Enabled - always consider nullability in code

## File Organization
- **Entry Point**: Program.cs in each executable project
- **Project Files**: .csproj files define project configuration

## Code Quality
- No .editorconfig file present yet
- No specific linting rules configured
- Follow standard .NET coding conventions

## Notes
- This is an early-stage project, more conventions may be established as the codebase grows
- Event sourcing patterns and domain-driven design principles should be followed when implementing new features
